Have you ever used a themed version of Chrome in full screen mode? If not you should give it a try! It almost looks and feels like a traditional desktop from say Windows Vista or XP (I thought long and hard about which way to include these in the text! #seo).

If Chrome engineers turn the tabs into windows that can be moved around within the parent Chrome window then they will have hijacked our desktop (or at least, the user has willingly let them hijack the desktop by pressing F11). Imagine using a whole host of Rich Internet Applications via Chrome this way!

Here is a screen capture of my Chrome browser as it might appear as a full desktop. You can see my <a title="Focus Booster App" href="http://www.focusboosterapp.com/" target="_self">Focus Booster App </a>is open and always above my desktop. It looks great with the downloaded [chrome distance theme][1] too!
