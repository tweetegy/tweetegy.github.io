<p class="message">
I am a <b>Full Stack Blockchain Developer</b>. I love building modern Dapps for cutting edge Decentralized Finance (DeFi) systems used in payments, lending, money markets and trading. I've recently designed and architected a payments solution and eKYC system being deployed in South East Asia.
<br />
<br />
<b>As a Full Stack Blockchain Developer, I can:</b>
</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
    <b>Design Blockchain Solutions:</b> talking to business stakeholders, technical teams, end users to gather requirements, limitations and challenges with the proposed system. Documenting these designs using UML.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Refactor Blockchain Designs:</b> as the systems are being built out certain discoveries are made with the limitation of the design. As such the design is refactored as required.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Build Blockchain Applications:</b> I am a software engineer with 20+ years of experience of coding complex business systems. I have built systems in a number of platforms and now my tools are a mixture of Solidity, JavaScript, Node JS, React Js and Vue JS.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Test Blockchain Applications:</b> as a practitioner of test driven development (TDD) for the last +10 years, I always deliver applications that include a full set of unit and integration tests. Typically for Dapps, I'll use Jest, Chai, Sinon and Nightwatch JS.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Deploy & Monitor Blockchain Systems:</b> work with experienced DevOps engineers to deploy, monitor and scale blockchain systems. I'll typically use Amazon Web Services for cloud based deployment together with a number of logging and monitoring tools.
    </li>
  </ul>

  I can work on projects that require all of the above or just a subset. Maybe you already have a blockchain application which requires tests or you already have the designs and specifications and require help with coding the Smart Contracts and Dapp front end. I am able to fit into any of the stages of a blockchain project and provide value to the team and the development of the product as suited.
